### Translation:
For contribution as translator, you don't need Xcode or macOS. [Here](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/Sentinel-iOS/tree/develop/localization/en) you can find the files that need to be translated. For `.strings` files you can use any text editor and for `.xliff` files you can use one of many free [online editors](http://xliff.brightec.co.uk).
